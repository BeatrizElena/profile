                    <p class="main1a">Zero is one of those concepts we now take for granted but it was not always thought of as a number in ancient cultures. Here are some tidbits of what historians know: </p>
                <ul class="main1b">
                    <li>The number zero arrived in Europe ~1200 through Fibonacci (Leonardo of Pisa).</li>
                    <li>The historical record points to the concept of zero first arising  more as a placeholder, a space. But initially, no symbol was assigned to it.</li>
                    <li>Two ancient cultures seem to have developed zero as a number somewhere between the first and the fourth century A.D.</li>
                    <li>Zero appeared in Mayan culture sometime in the early A.D. centuries.</li>
                    <li>It appeared in India sometime in the fourth century A.D.</li>
                </ul>
